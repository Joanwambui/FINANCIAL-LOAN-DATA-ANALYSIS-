# Introduction
This main aim of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on a Prosper loan dataset. I will be using Python libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns, and relationships.
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
In Part II, Explanatory data visualization illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that are discovered in the dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings would be through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
